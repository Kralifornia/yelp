- To run python code independently from the IDE

  3. In the webpage of GitLab go to Profile-->SSH Keys and click Add SSH Key
  4. Paste the copied content.
  5. Now you can clone, push, pull to the desired repository
- To update git in the server while there is other code executing
  > git reset --hard HEAD
  > git pull
- To replace several files with the same prefix name by another prefix
  for file in fileprefix*
  do
      mv -i "${file}" "${file/fileprefix_/replacement_}"
  done
- To add a comma (or anything) at the end of each line using a regular expression
  Search for ([^\n])$ and replace it by \1,
- To quote all the words in a text file by using regular expression

  Also use this line right after importing matplotlib
  mpl.use('TkAgg')
