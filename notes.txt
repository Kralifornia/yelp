- To execute a python file from the command line, place this two lines at the beginning of the file that is going to be executed:
  import sys
  sys.path.append('/Users/fpena/UCC/Thesis/projects/yelp/source/python')
- One can also declare the PYTHONPATH variable before executing the python command:
  PYTHONPATH='/Users/fpena/UCC/Thesis/projects/yelp/source/python' python program.py
- To shuffle the contents of a text use
  cat myfile | perl -MList::Util=shuffle -e 'print shuffle(<STDIN>);'
- To run python and keep the constantly updated in a file use:
  stdbuf -oL nohup python context_recommender_tests.py > results4.log &
- Command to run the iPython notebook:
  ipython notebook --pylab inline
- To expand the memory a process can use the shmmax command
- To download the code from the cluster use:
  http_proxy="http://4c.ucc.ie:80" https_proxy="http://4c.ucc.ie:80" wget -c https://github.com/melqkiades/yelp/archive/master.zip
- To install Anaconda and get everything running use:
  bash Anaconda-2.3.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
  conda update --all
  conda install gensim
- Set this variable in order to be able to run parallel code using the multiprocessing library in Python using Anaconda in Mac
  export VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS=1
- To count the number of finished instances in the execution log
  grep -o 'seconds' results46.log | wc -l  
- To kill all the processes from a given user
  pkill -u fpena
- To serialize a python object into a file
  with open(my_file, 'wb') as write_file:
      pickle.dump(my_reviews, write_file, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
- To read a serialized python object from a file
  with open(my_file, 'rb') as read_file:
      my_reviews = pickle.load(read_file)
- To start an ipython notebook
  ipython notebook --pylab inline
  In new versions the command is
  ipython notebook
  and then add the following line at the begining of the notebook
  %matplotlib inline
  or
  %pylab inline
- To push using git in the command line
  git push origin master
- To group by in a pandas dataframe
  data_frame = DataFrame(my_records, columns=['business_id'])
  df_agg = data_frame.groupby(['business_id']).size()
- To split a file by percentage
  split -l $(echo $(( $(cat sample.csv | wc -l) * 80 / 100))) sample.csv sample.csv
- To run python code independently from the IDE
  stdbuf -oL nohup python python_program.py > results.log &
- To add an ssh key for gitlab
  1. > ssh-keygen -t rsa
  2. Copy the contents of the generated file .ssh/id_rsa.pub
  3. In the webpage of GitLab go to Profile-->SSH Keys and click Add SSH Key
  4. Paste the copied content.
  5. Now you can clone, push, pull to the desired repository
- To update git in the server while there is other code executing
  > git reset --hard HEAD
  > git pull
- To replace several files with the same prefix name by another prefix
  for file in fileprefix*
  do
      mv -i "${file}" "${file/fileprefix_/replacement_}"
  done
- To add a comma (or anything) at the end of each line using a regular expression
  Search for ([^\n])$ and replace it by \1,
