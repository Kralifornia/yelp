      "# Clustering Collaborative Filtering Recommender System Using Eculidean Distance\n",
      "\n",
      "In this notebook we are going to explain how the Recommender system called Clu_CF_Euc that appears in the paper 'Multi-Criteria Service Recommendation Based on User Criteria Preferences' is implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement this recommender system we have created a class called <b>CluCFEuc</b> which contains several methods, the most important of all which is <b>predict_rating(user_id, item_id)</b>.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following sections we are going to describe the most important parts of the <b>CluCFEuc</b> class\n",
      "\n",
      "## Initializer\n",
      "In the firsts versions of this class the recommendations took a long time to be computed and that because a lot of calculations had to be done each time a rating of an item was to be predicted for a user. To solve this, many of the calculations are done before engaging recommendations and are stored as attributes of the object. The information that is pre-calculated is:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Users: A dictionary containing all the users in the train data, where the key is the user ID and the value is an user object. Each user object contains a user ID, the average overall rating that this user has given to hotels, the criteria weights of this user, the cluster this user belongs to, and the overall ratings that this user has given to the items he/she has reviewed.\n",
      "* User clusters: A dictionary containing all the clusters, where the key is the name of the cluster and the value is a list of all the IDs of the users that belong to this cluster.\n",
      "* User reviews: A dictionary containing all the reviews the users have made, where the key is the user ID and the value is a list of the reviews this user has made.\n",
      "* Users' similarities matrix: A dictionary that contains the similaries between each pair of users, where the key is the user ID and the value is another dictionary that contains the numerical values of the similarity between this user and the other ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the user IDs and the item IDs that are present in the training data are also stored in attributes for easy access.\n",
