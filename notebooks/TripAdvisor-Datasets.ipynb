      "Nov 1 2009 \tPerfect location\tWe finished our honeymoon in London and, being the third Hilton we stayed in during 12 days, I must say that it was the lowest point during our &quot;Hilton Honeymoon&quot;. That doesn't mean that the hotel was not good. It was great for other reasons. I'm only saying that the others were better. Now, the good things: Perfect location. 5 blocks away from Paddington Station (priceless if you arrive to or depart from Heathrow since you can catch the Heathrow Express/Connect). You have 3 underground lines in front of the hotel (Edgware Road Station) and it's only 10-minute walk from Hyde Park/Marble Arch/Oxford Street. The room was small but ok, with a great king size bed. The room was in the 10th floor of the Wing Tower so the view was nice. In our case, price was another good thing. We found the hotel through Hotwire and 100 USD per night for a Hilton in London sounded like a bargain. It was definitely a good value for money. We didn't have breakfast included (although complimentary tea/coffee is offered in the room), but we had a Marks &amp; Spencer right in front of the hotel and a Tesco round the corner. Considering that the hotel was full, it wasn't noisy at all. Overall, it was very good at met our expectations.\t\n",

      "&lt;Content&gt;Excellent Beach - Hotel construction woes An otherwise excellent holiday was initially marred by construction glitches. Upon arrival, we were asked to wait until our room was ready. We were invited to dine at the buffet while waiting only to be told by the staff at the restaurant that the buffet was closed. After speaking with the restaurant manager, we were escorted to the Italian restaurant where we enjoyed a delicious meal. We returned to the Front Desk and Rafael Norburto Aquino, a bellman for the Hotel, took us to our room. The one bedroom suite was gorgeous, however, both the light fixtures in the shower and toilet areas were dangling from the ceiling. There was a box of electrical bits on the floor. Rafael very professionally moved into action and spoke with several people to have the wiring completed. We were impressed with his professionalism and fluency in English which was a life saver because we unfortunately speak little Spanish. He also arranged to have a second bed delivered. We had requested this when booking the hotel, but there appeared to be no record of our request. After a few hours, the suite was finally available for our use. We took a shower only to find that there was a cap on the drain and the room flooded because of the lack of proper drainage. We called the Front Desk three times before someone finally called maintenance. One hour later, a maintenace person came and using a screwdriver, broke a hole in the cap to allow the water to drain. It took another 30 minutes to have someone mop up the excess water. Apparently we were the first guests to use the suite. The wait staff in the restaurants are excellent as is the food. We recommend the Italian and Argentinian restaurants -- and the buffet has an excellent variety of food. In the late afternoon, we would listen to a great piano player who also performs in the French restaurant.We were also impressed with Olmaira, the Manager of Guest Services. We did speak with her regarding our challenges with the hotel and the professionalism of Rafael.Once the construction glitches have been remedied, this will be an excellent hotel.<br/>\n",
